# Version history of the annotation labels

Older versions are kept in the folder `labels/<version>` in the form of sets of TSV files.

## v0.1

The original labels created by Alexander Faschon in the form of text files before the idea of
annotating directly in MuseScore existed (around 2017).

They have been programmatically inserted into MuseScore 2 files at a later point (end 2018), which
involved a few systematic syntax updates. These updates are documented in file correction_log.md.

## v0.2

This version designates the first commit of this repository. It corresponds to a full review 
involving several stages and actors. Mainly, nos. 01-04 were reviewed by Johannes Hentschel, and
the other songs by Adrian Nagel. The review was performed using version 1.0.0 of the DCML 
annotation as understood at that time (mid-2019). The updates during the review have been manually 
tracked and are now compiled in the file correction_log.md.
