# Version history of the annotation labels

## v0.1

The original labels created by Alexander Faschon in the form of text files before the idea of
annotating directly in MuseScore existed (around 2017).

They have been programmatically inserted into MuseScore 2 files at a later point (end 2018), which
involved a few systematic syntax updates. These updates are documented in file correction_log.md.
